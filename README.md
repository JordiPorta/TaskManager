I started creating this desktop app after my colleagues and I finished a video game project. I found it really interesting because, during the development, we were using some Agile methodologies. I thought it would be nice to have my own app to start using Scrum or Kanban.

The technologies used are Java and JavaFX, along with Scene Builder, which makes it really easy for me to create the user interface.
